Test cases are written by creating a new directory, containing a list
of files to be interpreted, and a file called `files` that lists those
file, in the order in which they should be interpreted/linked.

runtests.sh runs the tests -- if passed a directory name as argument,
it runs only that test, otherwise it tests everything.

checktests.sh checks that the tests are correct by running them using
the official OCaml implementation rather than the interpreted. If your
test fails this check, the test is quite probably wrong.

There is no explicit support for reporting success/failure of a test;
you should write your tests so that success is doing nothing, and
failure fails visibly -- for example, using `assert` to check for the
expected result or fail loudly.
